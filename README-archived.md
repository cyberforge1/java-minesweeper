## Tech Stack
- Java
- CLI
- Git

## Goals
The primary goal is to build a functional Minesweeper game that runs in the Java console, focusing on core gameplay mechanics and simple user interactions.

## How to Use
1. Run the application from your Java console.
2. Enter coordinates to reveal squares.
3. Avoid mines and clear the board to win!

## Implementation
- **MVP (basic requirements):** Generates a 10x10 grid with 10 randomly placed mines, capturing user input through the Java console.
- **User Interface:** Utilizes System.out and Scanner to interact with the user, displaying the grid and results of actions.
- **Logic Strategy:** Employs arrays to handle game logic, updating the state based on user input and calculating adjacent mines.

## Code / Important Elements / Design Decisions
Focused on object-oriented programming principles to structure the game efficiently, with separate classes for the game board and cells to enhance maintainability and scalability.

## Issues & Bugs
No major issues are currently known. Future testing may be needed to refine edge cases and improve error handling.

## Future Additions & Improvements
- Implement user-configurable settings for mines and grid size.
- Track wins and losses via a file.
- Expand to a web application for broader accessibility.

## Learning Highlights
Gained practical experience in managing game state and user interactions within a console-based application, reinforcing Java programming skills and object-oriented design.
