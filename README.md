## Goals & MVP
The primary goal is to build a functional Minesweeper game that runs in the Java console, focusing on core gameplay mechanics and simple user interactions.


## Tech Stack
- Java
- CLI
- Git

## How to Use
1. Run the application from your Java console.
2. Enter coordinates to reveal squares.
3. Avoid mines and clear the board to win!


## Design Goals
- Focused on object-oriented programming principles to structure the game efficiently, with separate classes for the game board and cells to enhance maintainability and scalability.


## Project Features
- [x] Generates a 10x10 grid with 10 randomly placed mines, capturing user input through the Java console
- [x] Utilizes System.out and Scanner to interact with the user, displaying the grid and results of actions
- [x] Employs arrays to handle game logic, updating the state based on user input and calculating adjacent mines


## Additions & Improvements
- [ ] Addition of ASCII art to enhance visual appeal
- [ ] Add suggested vectors to simplify code
- [ ] Provide a key of directions under the title
- [ ] Implement user-configurable settings for mines, sign-in, grid size and levels of difficulty
- [ ] Provide ability for the user to flag squares
- [ ] Track wins and losses via a file
- [ ] Expand to a web application for broader accessibility
